## 🚩 Phishing Indicators Identified

| Indicator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ Sender Spoofing | `security@paypa1.com` mimics PayPal (real domain is `paypal.com`) |
| 2️⃣ Urgent Language | “Failure to respond within 24 hours” creates panic |
| 3️⃣ Suspicious Link | Hover shows link is not `paypal.com` but `paypal-verify-now.com` |
| 4️⃣ Generic Greeting | “Dear Customer” instead of your name |
| 5️⃣ Poor Grammar | Example: “Failure to respond will result in permanent suspension” sounds overly aggressive |
| 6️⃣ No Personal Info | Legit services usually address by name |
| 7️⃣ Fake URL Display | Link text and destination don’t match |
| 8️⃣ Threatening Consequences | Creates fear to force quick action |
